# Employee Payroll Tracker Starter Code

## Description
This week, I had the opportunity to use JavaScript to build an employee payroll tracker. The JavaScript gives the user the ability to enter the names and salaries of employees. Once all of the names have been entered into the array, the names will be sorted alphabetically by last name. If the user checks the console log after running, there will be a table showing the names and salaries that were entered, as well as the messages that were requested.
